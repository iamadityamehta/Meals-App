# Meals App
 The meals app refers to the various meals which contains Ingrediants and steps to create specific meal. There are several features like favourite meals, drawer and filters. The meals are displays according to the filters you select. You can mark meals as favourite by pressing heart / favourite icon. There are different categories of meals. I built this app using the latest material 3 design of flutter which makes the application even better with beautiful UI and components. It's simple application but the features and UI made it more impactful.

> Note: This project was developed earlier during my learning phase in mobile application development. I am currently focusing on Cyber Security and related domains.
